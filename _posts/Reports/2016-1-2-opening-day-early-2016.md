Today was the first day of the new regulations for the Wisconsin early trout season.
It now opens the first Saturday in January (as opposed to March) so today was my first time fishing this early in the year.
In past years I would wait until the tempeture was well above freezing to make my first trip to the stream. 
So when I left the house this moring and the tempature was 20°, my expectations were not high.

## Preparation
With it being so cold, I wanted to spend as much time fishing and less time dicking around as possible.
I picked a spot I know well and didn't have to walk far from my vehicle. 
I assembled my outfit (rod, reel, leader, tippet, fly - everything) at home so I didn't have to do it outside.

## First Fish
I didn't have to wait long for my first fish of 2016. 
After throwning on my waiders, grabbing my sling-pack and rod, I headed for a couple of deep slow bends in the stream just a couple hundred feet off the road.

The fly rod is probably the most important peice of equipment you will buy.

## My Mistake
Before I took up fly fishing, I had already been spin fishing for trout for years.
So when I decided to pick up a fly rod, I made the mistake of using the same logic to pick a fly rod as I do my spinning rods.

- thought same rod choice would be good
- bought a short and light rod
- not good for a lot of situations

## Rod Material
- Go with graphite

## Rod Weights
- Go from 0 to 15
- corrilates to what line you should use with it
- bigger the number, heavier the line 
- 5 weight

## Rod Lengths
- 9 feet

## Where to go
- Find a fly shop
- Avoid the big-box stores
- Avoid kit rods

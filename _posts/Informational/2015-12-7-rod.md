The fly rod is probably the most important piece of equipment you will buy, and this is where you should invest most of your money.

## My Mistake
Before I took up fly fishing, I had already been trout fishing for years using spinning rods.
So when I decided to pick up a fly rod, I made the mistake of using the same logic to pick a fly rod as I do my spinning rods.
I ended up buying a short (by fly rod stardards) and light rod, a St. Croix Imperial 7' 3-weight.
I love this rod and have caught a lot of fish with it, but it's only useful in a limited number of situations.


- thought same rod choice would be good
- bought a short and light rod
- not good for a lot of situations

## Rod Material
- Go with graphite

## Rod Weights
- sizes range from 0 to 15
- correlates to what line you should use with it
- bigger the number, heavier the line 
- 5 weight

## Rod Lengths
- 9 feet

## Where to go
- Find a fly shop
- Avoid the big-box stores
- Avoid kit rods

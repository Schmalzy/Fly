When I first descided to give fly fishing a try, I did not know a single person I could ask for advice.
This made just getting strated and learning the basics the hardest part.
With no one to help guide me, the next logical place to go was Google.

While I was able to find the info I needed online, but I also found that the fly fishing community is not the most tech-savy bunch.
Most infomrational (non-commercial) sites look like there straight out of the days of AOL and Dial-up connections.
This does not make the content any less true or valuable, but it does make it harder to find quality advice.

This blog is my attempt to share and consolidate all of the usefull things I have found an learned over the past few years.
Hopefully it will save beginners out there some time and money in the process.

When I first decided to give fly fishing a try, I did not know anyone with experience fly fishing.
This made just getting started and learning the basics very difficult.
I had a lot of questions and no one to ask them too.
So the next logical place to look for answers was Google.

## Why a Blog?
While I was able to find the info I needed online, I also found that the fly fishing community is not the most tech-savvy bunch.
Most informational (non-commercial) sites look like there straight out of the days of AOL and Dial-up connections, and haven't been updated since Y2K was a thing.
This does not make the content of the sites any less valuable, but it does make it harder to find answers.

This blog is my way of trying to bring the fly fishing community into the modern age.
It's an attempt to share and consolidate all of the useful things I have found and learned over the past few years.
Hopefully it will save beginners out there some time and money in the process.

## Investment
Getting into any outdoor sport is an investment, and fly fishing is no exception.
But it's actually not as bad as you would think.
Start with the bare essentials and work your way up from there.

## Bare Essentials
There are six things need to start fly fishing. 
If someone tells you otherwise, they are just trying to sell you something.

1. [Rod](/informational/rod.html)
2. [Reel](/informational/reel.html)
3. [Fly Line](/informational/line.html)
4. [Leader](/informational/Leader.html)
5. [Flies](/informational/flies.html)
6. [Water](/informational/water.html)

I have broken up each of these essential items into their own blog posts.
